## PCB Design

## Design Notes
- Possibly replace 4N25 DIP with dual channel LTV-827 SMD
- Look at openhome for hardware/software ideas https://www.tindie.com/products/vysocan/openhome-security-gateway-17c/
- RS485 interface for wired keypad and/or nodes. Use ST3485 (lower cost) or MAX3483/MAX3486 (more features) for interface
